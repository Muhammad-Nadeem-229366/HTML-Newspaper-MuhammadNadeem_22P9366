## Original Newspaper
- **Name:** نوائے جنگ (Nawa-i-Jang) - "Voice of War/Struggle"
- **Date:** September 7, 2020 (Volume 17, Issue 42)
- **Source:** UK-based Urdu community newspaper serving London's South Asian community

## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of Nawa-i-Jang, a prominent UK-based Urdu newspaper. The original layout features a distinctive two-tone masthead (green and red), Quranic verses, multiple column articles, and historical photographs from the 1974 constitutional amendment period. My HTML recreation maintains the visual hierarchy and multi-column structure using semantic HTML5 tags and table-based layouts for newspaper-style formatting, with all styling accomplished through inline CSS attributes.

## Features Implemented
- **Semantic HTML5 Structure**: Proper use of `<header>`, `<div>`, `<table>`, `<footer>`, and heading hierarchy (h2-h5)
- **Multi-Column Table Layouts**: Three-column main section (27%-5%-22%) and four-column lower section (14%-21%-20%-15%)
- **Nested Tables**: Masthead uses two-cell table for green/red split design
- **Multiple Images**: Mosque logo, political leader portrait, historical conference photograph (all with alt attributes)
- **Inline Styling**: Colors, borders, padding, positioning, gradients via style attributes
- **Ordered List**: Historical conference key points enumerated list
- **HTML Comments**: Detailed comments explaining purpose of each major section
- **Proper Indentation**: Consistent 2-space indentation throughout
- **Arabic Text Support**: Right-to-left (RTL) text rendering with appropriate fonts
- **Responsive Widths**: Percentage-based table column widths for flexible layout
- **Color Palette**: Accurate color matching - green (#006400), red (#cc0000), black (#000), orange (#ff6600)
- **Quranic Verse Display**: White rounded pill box (border-radius: 25px) containing Arabic text on black background
## Challenges Faced
Recreating the newspaper's dense layout with overlapping sections was challenging using only inline HTML styles. I solved this using relative positioning with negative top values and percentage-based table columns to match the original's multi-column asymmetric design.
